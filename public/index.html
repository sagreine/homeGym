        Our Privacy Policy applies to our websites, our mobile application, and all other HomeGym Services (as that term is defined in our Terms of Service). 
        It covers personal information, which is information we can link to you personally. 
        Personal Information (“PI”) includes data like your name, email address, phone number, or mobile device’s unique identifier, among other things.
        
        
        HomeGym reserves the right to change this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in the law, our data collection and use practices, the features of our services, or advances in technology.

        1. We Collect Information to Provide You with HomeGym Services
        We are committed to only collecting the information necessary to provide and improve HomeGym Services. 
        When we do collect your information, we store it and associate it with your account unless otherwise noted. 
        We take your privacy very seriously and will only use and disclose this information as described in this Privacy Policy.
        
        Note that some of our products are standalone products, collect only limited information or no information at all. Not every section of this Privacy Policy will apply to these products.
        
        2. Information HomeGym Collects
        a. Registration Information
        
        To create an account, you must provide your email address and a password. This may be created within the application or may be obtained through a federated provider, for example Google, if you choose.
        If you register through a federated provider HomeGym may use additional infomation provided by that provider, such as your profile picture, nickname, or phone number, only
        to display such information, and only to you while logged in to your account. HomeGym will not separately store this information. In most cases, though HomeGym is not responsible for this, 
        you can interact with that federated provider to limit what information is shared to applications such as HomeGym. Because HomeGym does not store this information, changes you make in your 
        federated account provider account should propogate to HomeGym as soon as it is made available to HomeGym, subject to any on-device caching handled at the manufacture level.
        You may also enter your mobile phone number on our website to initiate a text message with directions on how to download the app and register.
        
        b. Credit Card Information
        
        If you purchase a HomeGym Service subscription directly from us, we collect your credit card number, expiration date, security code and other applicable billing information. 
        We use this information to bill you for services. HomeGym uses third-party payment processors and therefore has only limited information about your payment transactions.
        
        c. Device Information
        
        When you use HomeGym Services, our servers automatically record certain information about your mobile device. 
        This information may include an equipment identifier (e.g., IMEI, UDID), subscriber identifier (e.g., IMSI), device name, mobile phone number, device type and manufacturer, 
        operating system type and version, wireless carrier/operator, network type, country of origin, Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, 
        and the dates and times of your requests. We use this information to provide our services, and support if needed, and to create de-identified or aggregate information about our users. 
        For example, collecting your device’s phone number allows the service to contact your phone via SMS when you locate your phone from the HomeGym web application.
        
        d. Employment Application Information
        
        If you wish to fill out our employment application form, we will ask for information, including your name, email address, phone number, and allow you to upload your resume and cover letter. 
        We use this information to determine if you are an eligible candidate for an available position, to contact you to set up an interview if appropriate and to follow up with you about your application experience.
        
        e. Social Media Features
        
        Our website includes social media Features (“Features”), like the Facebook recommend button or interactive mini-programs that run on our site. 
        If you use these Features, they will collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our site, and set a cookie to enable the Feature to function properly. 
        Features may be hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our site. 
        Your interactions with these Features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing the Feature, not by HomeGym’s Privacy Policy.
        
        f. Information About Your Use of HomeGym Services on Your Phone
        
        We may use analytics software so that we can improve the features and usability of our products. 
        This software may analyze information such as how often you use the application, the events that occur within the application, and where the application was downloaded. 
        We may also use such information to show you relevant content and suggest new features, products and services that can enhance your use of the HomeGym Service. 
        We do not link the information we store within the analytics software to any personally identifiable information you submit within the mobile app.
        
        g. Information About Your Use of HomeGym's Websites (including Mobile Websites) and Emails
        
        We use analytics services to measure how people use our website and emails so that we can improve our products and services and provide more relevant content to you. 
        Analytics services may work by embedding invisible images that are associated with unique identifiers on our site, by using cookies or other local device storage or by using web beacons, web bugs, clear gifs, and similar tracking technologies.
        
        h. Premium Content & Promotions
        
        We may ask for your email address and other contact information in order to access various HomeGym content, such as whitepapers, videos, or other research materials, to participate in surveys, contests, promotions, or sweepstakes, or to obtain additional information about HomeGym services and products. 
        This information will be used to provide you with additional information on products and services from HomeGym or our business partners, which might be of interest to you. 
        You can choose not to receive such marketing communications by clicking on the unsubscribe link in our emails, as further described below.
        
        i. Location Information
        
        Some features we offer work better if we know what area you are in. HomeGym may collect location information in two ways. 
        We may receive it directly from your mobile device, or, in some situations, we may receive location data from cell tower or Wi-Fi hotspot information. 
        We may use third-party service providers to translate that information into usable location information.
        
        j. Other Information You Provide to Us
        
        To the extent you use our products or services to voluntarily provide us with any other information, we may collect such information and use it for the purposes for which you provided such information, or as otherwise provided in this Privacy Policy. 
        We also collect information described in the following section.
        
        3. What You Should Know About Specific Products
        This section provides additional information about specific services and features that are part of the HomeGym Services. 
        The information is used as described in this section and in the section entitled “How We Use the Information We Collect” below.
        
        a. HomeGymTV App
        
        HomeGym Backup stores copies of data that you choose to back up from your phone.
        
        What types of information Backup collects:
        
        Backup Data.
        HomeGym Backup transmits a copy of the data you choose to back up to on your device to Google Cloud storage. 
        The data may include your exercise history, videos you record in the application, and other data from within the application (e.g. the weight plates you own).   
        Access to this data is limited to authorized users and the developer of HomeGym. The developer will only access this data in the case of troubleshooting issues.
        HomeGym will never ask you for your password.      
        How the information that Backup collects is used:
        
        If you use HomeGymTV mobile application, we will use the data you provide to deliver the HomeGym Backup service.         
           
        4. Cookie Policy
        Types of Cookies
        
        Like many online services, we use cookies and other tools to collect and analyze information about you and your usage of our products and services. 
        We also use these technologies to deliver content for relevant HomeGym products and services. Cookies are small data files that we store on your computers or device. For details, see aboutcookies.org.
        
        How We Use Cookies
        
        We may use “session” cookies to keep you logged in while you use our services, to better understand how you interact with our services, and to monitor aggregate usage and web traffic information on our services. 
        Session cookies disappear when you log out and close your browser. 
        We also use “persistent” cookies to recognize you when you return to our services. 
        Persistent cookies can stay on your computer for a longer period of time than session cookies do. 
        We also use “analytical” cookies. They allow us to recognize and count the number of visitors and to see how visitors move around our services and how they’re using them. 
        This helps us to improve the way our website works, for example by making sure users are finding what they need easily. 
        Finally, we may use other standard technologies, such as web beacons, web bugs, clear gifs, and local storage, to analyze, collect and aggregate data about your use of our products and services.
        
        Cookies From Third-Parties
        
        We believe it is important for you to know exactly what third-party cookies we use on our website and services. We do not currently use any third-party cookies. 
        As we develop and improve our services, we may use other third parties that are not listed and will update this list at that time.
        
        5. How We Use the Information We Collect
        In addition to the specific uses described above, we also use your information in the following manner:
        
        a. We Use Your Information to Provide, Improve, and Promote our Services.
        
        We use your information to provide you with a better service, to improve our products and services, to promote our services and to develop new services. For example:
        
        If you fill out a survey or email HomeGym for support, we may retain that information in order to provide you with support and to improve our services.        
        We may send text messages to your phone to communicate with your device.
        We may use your email address or mobile number to send privacy or security related notices and notify you of major HomeGym services changes.
        We may use your email address or mobile phone number to communicate about product announcements and special promotions from HomeGym or our business partners, or to administer participation in special events, surveys, contests and sweepstakes.
        We may use your information to conduct market research and engage in joint promotional activities with companies that have products that can add value to HomeGym products or services (for example, with supplement companies).
        b. We May Disclose Your Information in Accordance with the Law.
        
        Like other companies, we may disclose your information consistent with the law to, for example: (i) comply with a law, regulation, or legal process (including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements); (ii) protect the safety or security of any person, entity or facility; (iii) address potential violations of our Privacy Policy or Terms of Service; (iv) investigate fraud, security, or technical issues; or (v) protect HomeGym’s or a third party's rights or property, our employees, users and the public.
        
        We strongly believe that you have a right to know if we are required by law to disclose your information. 
        As such, before we disclose your Information in response to a law enforcement request (for example, a subpoena or court order), we will notify you at the email listed in your account, unless (a) we are prohibited from doing so or (b) in emergency cases where notice could create a risk of injury or death, or the case involves potential harm to minors. 
        Furthermore, nothing in this Privacy Policy is meant to limit any legal defenses or objections that you may have to a third party’s, including the government’s, request to disclose your information.
        
        c. We Share Your Information to Provide or Improve Our Services
        
        We do not currently share your information with third parties to provide or improve our services with the exception of Google Firebase tools for function and improvement of the application. 
        In the future we may perform additional sharing. For example:
        
        We may share your information with third party service providers of products and services integrated with our software that need to know your information to fulfill your product or service requests (for example, to map your location, send you an SMS or provide you with identity protection services), support our products and services, or analyze data for product performance and product improvement purposes.        
        We may share your information to perform accounting, auditing, billing reconciliation, and collection activities.
        We may share your information with our affiliates, resellers or other third party service providers that are working with HomeGym (for example, supplement companies) to ensure proper delivery of your purchase and related support services, perform business-related functions, and provide you with information about products and services.
        d. We Share Your Information to Avoid Unnecessary Marketing
        
        In order to prevent you from receiving duplicate or unnecessary marketing about HomeGym products or service, we may share your information or your status as a current HomeGym customer with our partners or service providers.
        
        e. We Share Data That is Aggregated and De-Identified
        
        We share de-identified or aggregated data publicly and with our partners and other third-parties. For example, we may share the number of devices that have ever encountered a particular piece of malware in our security reports.
        
        f. We May Disclose Your Information With Your Consent
        
        We may also share your personal information with third parties when we have your consent to do so.
        
        6. Your Choices
        a. You Can Access and Update Your Settings
        
        Your HomeGym Account on our website and/or the HomeGym ‘Settings’ page on our mobile application allow you to update or modify certain settings that affect what data is shared with us (for example, by disabling backups of certain types of data). To protect your privacy and security, we require your username and password in order to verify your identity before granting you account access or making changes. If you wish to correct or delete inaccuracies within your personal information, or to request access to any personal information we obtain about you, please contact us at homegymtvapp@gmail.com. We will respond to your request to access within 30 days. 
        In certain situations, however, HomeGym may not be able to provide access to or delete all of the personal information that it holds about you.
        
        b. Email Opt-Outs
        
        You may opt out of receiving promotional communications from HomeGym by using the unsubscribe link within each email. 
        Although opt-out requests are usually processed immediately, please allow ten (10) business days for a removal request to be processed.
        Even after you opt out from receiving promotional messages from us, you will continue to receive transactional and product-related messages from us regarding HomeGym Services. 
        You can opt-out of some of these notification messages in your account settings.        
        
        c. Personalized Advertisements
        
        You may be able to opt out of receiving certain personalized advertisements. Please visit the Network Advertising Initiative Consumer Opt-Out Page or the Digital Advertising Alliance Opt-Out Page to opt out directly from providers who participate in those programs. 
        HomeGym does not control or operate these tools or the choices that advertisers and others provide through these tools.
        
        d. Cookies
        
        Most Internet browsers automatically accept cookies, but some browsers may permit you to change your settings or use third-party tools to disable cookies or to prompt you before accepting cookies from the websites you visit. 
        These browsers or other third party tools may also permit you to delete cookies you already have. 
        Please be aware that some parts of our services may not work for you if you delete or disable cookies. For other options regarding cookies, please visit our Cookie Policy.
        
        e. Location
        
        When you delete location data through your account dashboard on HomeGym.com, it is no longer linked to your account and is de-identified on our application production systems.
        
        7. Data Retention Policy
        Our policy is to retain personally identifiable information only as long as reasonably necessary to provide our products and services to you and others or as otherwise required for legal compliance purposes. 
        We may delete your data if your account is inactive and as otherwise provided in our Terms of Service. 
        Currently for HomeGym Backup, our policy is to delete: (i) all Backup Data if you have not accessed our services for 90 consecutive days, or (ii) videos from your Backup Data if you have not upgraded to a Premium Subscription within 90-days after your Premium trial or if you have discontinued your Premium Subscription for 90 consecutive days. 
        We will generally notify you via the email address associated with your account before deleting your Backup Data. We may change that policy from time to time.
        
        8. Information Posted to Our Blog and Community Forum Is Public
        If you comment on our blog or other public forums, you should be aware that any information you submit there can be read, collected, or used by other users of those blogs, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages. 
        We are not responsible for the information you choose to submit in these blogs or for any content you receive as a result of sharing such information.
        
        To request removal of your personal information from our blog or community forum, contact us at homegymtvapp@gmail.com. If we are not able to remove your personal information, we will let you know why.
        
        9. We Take Security Seriously
        Securing your data is important to us. HomeGym uses commercially reasonable physical, managerial, and technical safeguards. 
        For example, we use a combination of firewalls, authentication, physical security, and other safeguards to protect your account and your data. 
        We do not process any payment data directly and will never ask you for payment information.         
        
        Because no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information, data or content that HomeGym receives on your behalf to operate the HomeGym services, or that you transmit to HomeGym. 
        All such receipt or transmission of your information is at your own risk. 
        We cannot guarantee that such information will not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.
        
        If HomeGym learns of a security breach, we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps. 
        HomeGym may also post a notice on the HomeGym services if a security breach occurs. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing.

        Note that a core, but optional, feature of HomeGym involves casting or flinging from your local device to a custom Android TV, FireStick, Chromecast, Roku, or similar application.
        This process involves communication between the application and your phone over your local network. HomeGym cannot guarantee that your personal network is secure, and thus cannot guarantee
        that this process is secure. For instance, if someone is snooping on your network and intercepts the call, they may have access to download or play the relevant video. However,
        all other access to HomeGym application data that is stored within Google Cloud Storage and related storage capabilities require access from an authorized user request (or the applciation owner account).
        
        10. You Are Responsible for Maintaining the Accuracy and Confidentiality of Your Email Address and Password
        You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your password at all times. 
        We recommend a strong password that you do not use with other services. 
        If you believe your password has been compromised, please change your password immediately via the HomeGym application, or contact us at homegymtvapp@gmail.com for assistance. 
        You are responsible for ensuring that the email address associated with your account is accurate. 
        We use that email to contact you about service updates, changes to our policies, and account activities such as requests for your information or locate attempts on your device. 
        HomeGym is not responsible for personal data transmitted to a third party as a result of a user’s providing an incorrect email address.

        HomeGym is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC).
